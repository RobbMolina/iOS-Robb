"Zuri´s revenge" = "Zuri´s revenge"

"The peace of the outer systems has been shattered. The scars of betrayal still burn in the heart of Zuri, a former warrior banished by the very council she swore to protect. Hunted by her former allies and stalked by merciless hunters, Zuri has wandered the darkest corners of hyperspace, nursing a single purpose: revenge. Now, a new conflict brews. With rumors of a weapon capable of altering the course of the war, Zuri prepares her return… and the echoes of her fury threaten to engulf the entire galaxy in shadow." = "The peace of the outer systems has been shattered.
